To have your local backend catch Stripe webhooks, you’ll need to follow a few steps to ensure Stripe can send events to your local machine. By default, Stripe will try to send webhooks to a publicly accessible URL, but since your backend is running locally, you’ll need a way to expose it to the internet.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Use ngrok or a similar tool**
   Since your backend is local, you’ll need to create a tunnel between your local server and the internet. You can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a public URL for your local server.

   - **Install ngrok**:
     Download and install ngrok by following the instructions on their website.

   - **Start ngrok**:
     In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your backend is running, and then run:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 3000
     ```
     Replace `3000` with the port your backend is running on. This will create a public URL that looks something like this:
     ```
     http://abcd1234.ngrok.io
     ```

### 2. **Set up a Webhook Endpoint in Your Backend**
   Make sure your backend has an endpoint ready to handle Stripe webhooks. Typically, this is a POST route like `/webhook`.

   Example in Node.js (Express):
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const stripe = require('stripe')('your-stripe-secret-key');
   const app = express();

   app.use(bodyParser.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));

   const endpointSecret = 'your-webhook-signing-secret'; // Obtain this from the Stripe Dashboard

   app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
     const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];

     let event;

     try {
       event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, endpointSecret);
     } catch (err) {
       console.log('Webhook signature verification failed:', err.message);
       return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
     }

     // Handle event (e.g., payment_intent.succeeded)
     if (event.type === 'payment_intent.succeeded') {
       const paymentIntent = event.data.object; // PaymentIntent object
       console.log('PaymentIntent was successful!');
     }

     res.json({ received: true });
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'));
   ```

   Ensure you replace `'your-stripe-secret-key'` and `'your-webhook-signing-secret'` with your actual Stripe keys and secrets.

### 3. **Configure Stripe to Send Webhooks to Your Local Endpoint**
   - Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com).
   - Navigate to **Developers > Webhooks**.
   - Click **+ Add endpoint**.
   - Add the ngrok URL (or the URL you created) followed by `/webhook`. For example:
     ```
     http://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook
     ```
   - Select the events you want Stripe to send to this endpoint (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`, `checkout.session.completed`, etc.).

### 4. **Test the Webhook**
   Stripe allows you to send test events from the Dashboard to your webhook endpoint.
   - In the **Webhooks** section of the Dashboard, click **Send test webhook**.
   - Choose an event and check if your local backend receives it correctly.

### 5. **Verify Stripe Signature (Optional but Recommended)**
   To ensure that the webhook is genuinely from Stripe, you should verify the signature. This helps protect your backend from malicious actors sending fake events. In the example above, we used `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` to verify the signature.

### 6. **Deploy to Production**
   Once you're confident your local setup works, you can deploy your backend to a production environment with a public URL to catch webhooks in a live setting.

By following these steps, you should be able to catch Stripe webhooks locally during development using ngrok or a similar tunneling service. Let me know if you need help with any of the steps!
