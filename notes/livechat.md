If you want the chat to be **individual user-to-user**, you can still use `Socket.io`, but you'll need to implement a way to **identify users** and ensure that messages are sent directly between two users, rather than broadcasting to all clients.

Here's a breakdown of how you can achieve this:

### 1. **Identify Users (Socket Connection with User IDs)**

Each user should be assigned a **unique identifier** (like a `userId` or `username`). When the client connects to the server, you'll associate the `userId` with the corresponding socket.

### 2. **Emit Direct Messages to Specific Users**

Instead of broadcasting to all clients, you'll send messages directly to a specific user's socket. You can achieve this by emitting messages to a socket associated with a particular user.

### Steps to Implement User-to-User Chat:

### 1. **Frontend (React - Vite)**

In the frontend, when a user sends a message, you'll need to specify who the message is intended for (the recipient). You can use `socket.emit` to send messages directly to the other user by their socket ID.

```jsx
// ChatComponent.jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import io from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:5000"); // Your backend URL

const ChatComponent = ({ currentUserId, recipientUserId }) => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  // Handle incoming messages
  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on("receiveMessage", (msg) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, msg]);
    });

    // Inform the server of the user ID when the component mounts
    socket.emit("register", currentUserId);

    return () => {
      socket.off("receiveMessage");
    };
  }, [currentUserId]);

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (message.trim()) {
      // Send the message to the recipient user
      socket.emit("sendMessage", {
        sender: currentUserId,
        recipient: recipientUserId,
        message,
      });
      setMessage(""); // Clear the input field
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="chat-box">
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="message">
            {msg.sender === currentUserId ? "You: " : "Other: "}
            {msg.text}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message"
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChatComponent;
```

- `currentUserId`: The ID of the user currently logged in.
- `recipientUserId`: The ID of the user they are chatting with.
- When a message is sent, it contains both the sender's and the recipient's user IDs, and the backend will use these IDs to route the message to the appropriate user.

### 2. **Backend (Express + Socket.io)**

On the backend, you'll store the socket connections for each user, so you can send messages directly to the intended user. You'll need to create a system to associate a `userId` with a `socketId`.

#### **Backend setup with Socket.io**:

```js
// server.js
const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");
const socketIo = require("socket.io");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server); // Socket.io instance attached to the server

let users = {}; // Store userId to socketId mappings

// Register the user's socket ID when they connect
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("New client connected");

  // Register the user by their ID (e.g., userId or username)
  socket.on("register", (userId) => {
    users[userId] = socket.id; // Store the userId and socketId
    console.log(`${userId} connected with socket ID: ${socket.id}`);
  });

  // Handle receiving a message and sending it to the recipient
  socket.on("sendMessage", (data) => {
    const { sender, recipient, message } = data;

    // Check if the recipient is connected
    const recipientSocketId = users[recipient];

    if (recipientSocketId) {
      // Send the message to the recipient's socket
      io.to(recipientSocketId).emit("receiveMessage", {
        sender,
        text: message,
      });
    } else {
      console.log("Recipient not connected");
    }
  });

  // Handle client disconnecting
  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    // Remove the user from the users object when they disconnect
    for (let userId in users) {
      if (users[userId] === socket.id) {
        delete users[userId];
        break;
      }
    }
    console.log("Client disconnected");
  });
});

// Start the server on port 5000
server.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:5000");
});
```

#### Key concepts here:
1. **User Registration**: When a user connects, they register their `userId` with their `socket.id` using the `register` event.
2. **Send Direct Messages**: When a message is received from a user, we check if the recipient is connected by looking up their `socket.id`. If they are connected, we send the message directly to their socket using `io.to(recipientSocketId).emit()`.
3. **Disconnect Handling**: When a user disconnects, we clean up their entry from the `users` object.

### 3. **How it works:**
- When a user connects, they register their `userId` with the server, allowing the server to keep track of which socket is associated with which user.
- When a message is sent from `sender` to `recipient`, the server checks if the recipient is connected (i.e., has a registered `socketId`), and if so, it sends the message only to that user's socket.

### 4. **Advanced Features:**
If you want to enhance the system, consider adding:
- **Message History**: Store the message history in a database (e.g., MongoDB) and retrieve it when a user joins the chat.
- **Typing Indicators**: Implement a typing indicator by emitting events when a user starts typing and stops typing.
- **Notifications**: You could send notifications when a message is received (e.g., a browser notification or a badge on the UI).

---

### Summary:
- **Frontend**: Send messages with `sender` and `recipient` IDs, and listen for messages using the `receiveMessage` event.
- **Backend**: Use Socket.io to track connected users and route messages to the correct user by their `socketId`.
- **User-to-User Messaging**: Ensure messages are only sent between specific users using their unique identifiers.
