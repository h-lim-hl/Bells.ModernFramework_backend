Great! You're asking about what **data** might need to be collected and made available to the **Data Professional (DP)** that the **Full Stack Professional (FSP)** might not prioritize for direct implementation on the e-commerce site, because it’s **more focused on analytics** and **business intelligence** rather than the core operational functions of the site.

In an **e-commerce platform**, the **Full Stack Professional (FSP)** typically focuses on implementing systems that support day-to-day operations like customer orders, payments, and inventory management. These tasks are essential for running the site. The **Data Professional (DP)**, on the other hand, may require additional, more nuanced or detailed data that helps with long-term **business strategy**, **performance optimization**, and **customer behavior analysis**.

Let’s break it down.

### Key Areas of Data Not Typically Handled by FSP but Needed by DP

#### 1. **Customer Behavioral Data**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: Full-stack developers are often concerned with transactions, orders, and website navigation, but deep customer behavioral data—like interaction patterns, session analytics, or specific triggers for customer actions—may be considered "extra" or not immediately needed for running the site.
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - **Session Data**: This includes information like:
       - `session_id`: A unique session identifier for tracking user behavior across different sessions.
       - `page_views`: A list of pages a customer visited within a session.
       - `time_spent_on_page`: Duration for which the user stayed on a particular page.
       - `events_tracked`: Actions like “added to cart,” “searched for products,” or “clicked on recommendations.”
       - `exit_intent`: Did the user attempt to leave the page, and did they abandon the cart? This helps identify churn or abandonment behavior.
       - `scroll_depth`: How far down the page the user scrolled (important for understanding engagement).
   
   - **Why It’s Important**: 
     This data helps the DP analyze **customer journeys** and identify potential bottlenecks, pain points, or areas for improving the site. The DP can then provide insights into improving user flow or testing UI/UX adjustments.

#### 2. **Advanced Customer Segmentation Data**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: While FSPs implement basic customer details (like `name`, `email`, and `order history`), **advanced segmentation data** might not be as urgent for the day-to-day running of the site. 
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: The total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with the business.
       - Formula: CLV = Average Purchase Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
     - **Churn Prediction**: Data regarding which users are likely to leave, based on engagement patterns, recent purchases, or inactivity.
     - **Customer Segments**: Derived segments based on behavior, location, spending patterns, etc.
       - `customer_segment`: Segments like high-value, repeat buyer, seasonal buyer, or one-time shopper.
     - **Product Preferences**: Insights into product categories the customer is most interested in.
       - `preferred_category`: E.g., "electronics," "clothing," "sports."
   
   - **Why It’s Important**: 
     This data allows the DP to create detailed customer profiles and groups, which can inform **personalization**, **targeted marketing campaigns**, and **pricing strategies**. Segmenting customers helps businesses tailor marketing efforts and identify opportunities to improve customer retention.

#### 3. **Abandoned Cart Data**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: The **FSP** might implement basic **cart functionality** (e.g., adding items to the cart, completing purchases), but detailed tracking of **abandoned carts** is typically more relevant for **data analysis** or marketing purposes.
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - `cart_id`: The ID of the cart that was abandoned.
     - `customer_id`: To track who abandoned the cart (if logged in).
     - `products_in_cart`: A list of all products added to the cart.
     - `time_spent_in_cart`: Time spent before abandonment.
     - `abandonment_reason`: If tracked, this could capture whether they left the cart due to pricing, shipping cost, or other reasons.
   
   - **Why It’s Important**:
     Analyzing **cart abandonment** helps the DP understand why people leave the site without completing purchases, which can be used to implement strategies like **retargeting ads**, **email reminders**, or **incentives** (e.g., offering discounts to people who abandoned carts). This can significantly boost **conversion rates**.

#### 4. **Conversion Funnel Data**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: FSPs may track basic transaction and checkout data, but specific metrics about the **conversion funnel** (from browsing to checkout) may not be implemented unless the business requests detailed funnel tracking.
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - **Funnel Stages**: Data on each stage a customer goes through during their purchase process:
       - `viewed_product`: Whether the customer viewed a product.
       - `added_to_cart`: Whether the customer added products to their cart.
       - `initiated_checkout`: When the user started the checkout process.
       - `completed_purchase`: When the user finished the purchase.
     - **Drop-off Points**: Where customers are leaving the funnel (e.g., abandoning the cart or leaving the checkout process).
   
   - **Why It’s Important**: 
     The DP can use funnel data to analyze **conversion rates** and **drop-off points**, helping optimize user experience and identify pain points. For example, if many customers abandon carts at the checkout, the business can consider offering easier payment options, reducing friction in the checkout process, or optimizing the UI.

#### 5. **Product Interaction and Engagement**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: The **FSP** might store basic product details (name, price, SKU, etc.), but deeper data on how users interact with specific products might not be as immediately relevant for the site’s core functionality.
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - `product_views`: Number of times a specific product was viewed.
     - `add_to_cart_rate`: Percentage of users who added the product to the cart after viewing it.
     - `product_comparison`: Data on how often users compare products.
     - `out_of_stock_views`: How many times a customer viewed a product that is out of stock.
   
   - **Why It’s Important**:
     This data helps the DP understand which products are the most engaging, which may lead to **product recommendations** and **inventory optimization**. If a product is often viewed but rarely purchased, this could indicate a pricing issue, lack of customer trust, or other concerns.

#### 6. **Customer Feedback, Reviews, and Sentiment**
   - **Why FSP Might Not Implement**: The **FSP** will likely implement systems for customers to leave **reviews** or **ratings** for products. However, **sentiment analysis** and deeper **feedback analysis** might be beyond the immediate scope of the site’s functionality.
   - **What the DP Needs**:
     - `review_score`: The score given by customers (e.g., 1-5 stars).
     - `review_text`: Textual feedback about the product or service.
     - `sentiment_analysis`: Extracted sentiment from the review (positive, negative, neutral).
   
   - **Why It’s Important**:
     Analyzing **customer sentiment** allows the DP to understand how products are perceived by customers, identify areas for improvement, and measure overall **customer satisfaction**. It can also inform product development and marketing strategies.
